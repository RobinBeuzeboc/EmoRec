"""
Sort the CK+ dataset into the corresponding emotions.

Before running the file, make sure you have done the following:
    - In data/ make two folders `source_emotions` and `source_images`.
      source_images contains the CK+ images, and source_emotions has the labels
    - Make a third folder `sorted_set` with subfolders for each emotions
      (sorted_set/anger, sorted_set/happy, etc)
    - Add the folders of the CK+ images/labels to the
      right folders (S005, S010, etc)

Once the above is done, the program can be run.

The images from CK+ will be sorted into the right folders based on the emotions
described in the label. Once this is done, you can run the `prepare_dataset.py`
file to crop the faces and prepare the files so they can be used
to train a model.
